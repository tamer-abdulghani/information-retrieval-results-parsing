# Information Retrieval Results Parsing
This project browse and explain part of TREC dataset study results.

# platforms and technologies used:

2. jFreeChart 1.0.19 java library for visualizing the data. 
3. Weka API 3.7.7 java library for Classification/Clustering functions.

So in order to run the project correctly make sure to include/import the two libraries (jFreeChart and Weka API 3.7.7).

# Software Architecture 
We choose to build this project on MVC architecture. The project structures contain four main packages which are the following: 
1.	Controllers Package: contain the main controller for this application.
2.	Gui Package (Views): contain the jFrames of the application
3.	Models: contains all java classes, types, and enums need to represent the data.
4.	Helpers: contains XMLHelper, CSVHelper, and ChartHelper.

# Resource Files needed
To run the application and display the results you need to use three main files which are:
-	Queries/Topics XML File
-	User Formulation XML Files
-	User Query Formulation Evaluation/Performance file.
-	Performance Files for Three Systems (CSV files)

Those files will be available soon!
